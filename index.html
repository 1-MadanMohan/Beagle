            sense of smell and tracking instinct.
            They are friendly, curious, and great with families. These dogs
            are often used for hunting and as detection dogs due to their
            excellent olfactory abilities.
            Beagles are typically friendly, curious, and great with
            families. They are known for their playful nature and love for

            animals, often getting along well with other dogs and pets.
